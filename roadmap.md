- **Advanced Features**: 20-67% Complete (infrastructure, methodology integration, and workflow features)
- **SDD Optimization**: 90% Complete (workflow flexibility with iterative development, enhanced UX, and completed mode switching with auto-detection)

**Note**: @agentic-sdlc-12-factors serves dual purposes as methodology documentation and reference implementation, providing working examples and command templates that accelerate Spec Kit development. Key SDD flexibility features are implemented via `/clarify` (iterative refinement), `/analyze` (consistency validation with auto-detection), and `/checklist` (requirements quality testing). **Complexity reduction prioritized** based on user feedback analysis - workflow modes provide user-choice flexibility (spec-driven structured mode as default vs lightweight build mode for exploration), iterative development support consolidated into extended `/analyze` command addresses anti-iterative concerns, flexible documentation modes with conversational `discuss.md` solve documentation overload, enhanced rollback capabilities provide task-level rollbacks, and configurable framework opinions make TDD/contracts/data models opt-in rather than mandatory. Context engineering optimization planned using stone-skipping metaphor for progressive context layering and verbalized sampling for AI output diversity.
