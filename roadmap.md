- **Core Workflow**: 100% Complete (constitution, dual execution, MCP integration)
- **Advanced Features**: 20-67% Complete (infrastructure, methodology integration, and workflow features)
- **SDD Optimization**: 95% Complete (workflow flexibility with iterative development, enhanced UX, completed mode switching with auto-detection, and mode-aware checklist validation)
- **Complexity Solutions**: ~100% Complete (completed workflow modes with auto-detecting post-implementation analysis, iterative development, enhanced rollback, configurable options - HIGH PRIORITY response to user feedback)
- **Next Phase Priorities**: 3 HIGH/MEDIUM priority features (iterative development, workflow orchestration completion, rollback capabilities) - **IMMEDIATE FOCUS**

**Note**: @agentic-sdlc-12-factors serves dual purposes as methodology documentation and reference implementation, providing working examples and command templates that accelerate Spec Kit development. Key SDD flexibility features are implemented via `/clarify` (iterative refinement), `/analyze` (consistency validation with auto-detection and post-implementation analysis), and `/checklist` (requirements quality testing with mode-aware framework option validation). **Complexity reduction prioritized** based on user feedback analysis - workflow modes provide user-choice flexibility (spec-driven structured mode as default vs lightweight build mode for exploration), iterative development support partially implemented via extended `/analyze` command with auto-detection addresses anti-iterative concerns, enhanced rollback capabilities provide task-level rollbacks, and configurable framework options make TDD/contracts/data models/risk-based testing opt-in rather than mandatory, with checklist validation ensuring enabled options are properly specified in requirements. Rich context delegation provides superior AI assistance compared to issue labeling approaches.
