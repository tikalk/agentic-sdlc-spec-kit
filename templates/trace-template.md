## Summary

### Problem
{PROBLEM_STATEMENT}

Brief description of the initial goal extracted from spec mission and all user stories. This should be 1-2 sentences summarizing what needed to be implemented.

**Example**:
- "Implement user authentication system with JWT tokens and refresh token rotation"
- "Implement blood coagulation cascade with Factor IX activation and proper enzyme sequencing"

### Key Decisions
{NUMBERED_DECISIONS_LIST}

Chronological list of significant decisions made during implementation. Includes architecture, technology, testing, process, and integration decisions.

**Example**:
1. Chose React with TypeScript for type-safe component development
2. Implemented TDD approach with 90%+ code coverage requirement
3. Applied dual execution loop with 5 SYNC (micro-reviewed) and 3 ASYNC (agent-delegated) tasks
4. Integrated issue tracking with 6 @issue-tracker references for traceability

### Final Solution
{OUTCOME_STATEMENT}

Brief description of what was accomplished with key metrics (quality gate pass rate, user story completion, evidence).

**Example**:
- "Delivered User Authentication implementation with 8/8 quality gates passed (100% pass rate). All 4 user stories implemented with comprehensive validation. Documented in commit a1b2c3d with 6 supporting issue tracker references."
