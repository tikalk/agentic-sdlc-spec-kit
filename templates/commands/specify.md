# Context Management & Validation

On every workflow command execution:
- [ ] Automatically assemble context from:
  - The local codebase (specs/, memory/constitution.md, etc.)
  - The team-ai-directives repository (memory/team-ai-directive/context_modules/)
  - Any user-linked external docs (allow user to add references)
- [ ] Validate context: Warn if key context (e.g., constitution.md, rules) is missing before proceeding.

description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.
scripts:
  sh: scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "{ARGS}"
  ps: scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "{ARGS}"
---

The text the user typed after `/specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
   **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.
2. Load `templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.
3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure.
   - Populate the "Mission Brief" section with the raw feature description.
   - Replace other placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
4. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, and readiness for the next phase.

Note: The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.
