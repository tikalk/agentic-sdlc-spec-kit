## MADR Template Quick Reference

**Status Values:**

- **Proposed**: Decision under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and in effect
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer applicable
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision (reference successor ADR)
- **Discovered**: Inferred from existing codebase (brownfield reverse-engineering)

**Good ADR Practices:**

- One decision per ADR
- Keep context concise but complete
- Document all seriously considered alternatives
- Be honest about trade-offs and risks
- Link related decisions for traceability
- Update status when decisions evolve

**Integration with Architecture:**

- System-level ADRs go in `.specify/memory/adr.md`
- Feature-level ADRs go in `specs/{feature}/adr.md`
- Feature ADRs should reference relevant system ADRs: "Aligns with ADR-XXX"
- Conflicts with system ADRs should be flagged as VIOLATION
