# Agentic SDLC Spec Kit

*Build high-quality software faster.*

**An effort to allow organizations to focus on product scenarios rather than writing undifferentiated code with the help of Spec-Driven Development.**

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king â€” specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the "*what*" before the "*how*"
- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## Development Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **0-to-1 Development** ("Greenfield") | Generate from scratch | <ul><li>Start with high-level requirements</li><li>Generate specifications</li><li>Plan implementation steps</li><li>Build production-ready applications</li></ul> |
| **Creative Exploration** | Parallel implementations | <ul><li>Explore diverse solutions</li><li>Support multiple technology stacks & architectures</li><li>Experiment with UX patterns</li></ul> |
| **Iterative Enhancement** ("Brownfield") | Brownfield modernization | <ul><li>Add features iteratively</li><li>Modernize legacy systems</li><li>Adapt processes</li></ul> |

## Experimental Goals

Our research and experimentation focus on:

### Technology Independence

- Create applications using diverse technology stacks
- Validate the hypothesis that Spec-Driven Development is a process not tied to specific technologies, programming languages, or frameworks

### Enterprise Constraints

- Demonstrate mission-critical application development
- Incorporate organizational constraints (cloud providers, tech stacks, engineering practices)
- Support enterprise design systems and compliance requirements

### User-Centric Development

- Build applications for different user cohorts and preferences
- Support various development approaches (from vibe-coding to AI-native development)

### Creative & Iterative Processes

- Validate the concept of parallel implementation exploration
- Provide robust iterative feature development workflows
- Extend processes to handle upgrades and modernization tasks

## Alignment with Agentic SDLC 12 Factors

Spec-Driven Development is built upon the [Agentic SDLC 12 Factors](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/) methodology, a comprehensive framework for software development with AI coding agents. The 12 factors provide the foundational principles that guide our approach:

- [I. Strategic Mindset](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/strategic-mindset.html): Developer as Orchestrator, AI as Intern
- [II. Context Scaffolding](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/context-scaffolding.html): Treat Context as a Dependency
- [III. Mission Definition](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/mission-definition.html): From Intent to Specification
- [IV. Structured Planning](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/structured-planning.html): Decompose and Triage Tasks
- [V. Dual Execution Loops](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/dual-execution-loops.html): Pair Program or Delegate Toil
- [VI. The Great Filter](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/great-filter.html): Apply Irreplaceable Human Judgment
- [VII. Adaptive Quality Gates](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/adaptive-quality-gates.html): Review Appropriately for Each Workflow
- [VIII. AI-Augmented, Risk-Based Testing](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/ai-augmented-testing.html): AI-Augmented, Risk-Based Testing
- [IX. Traceability](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/traceability.html): Linking the 'Why' to the 'How'
- [X. Strategic Tooling](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/strategic-tooling.html): Manage a Federated, Governed Stack
- [XI. Directives as Code](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/directives-as-code.html): Version and Share AI Behavior
- [XII. Team Capability](https://tikalk.github.io/agentic-sdlc-12-factors/content/team-capability.html): Systematize Learning and Improvement

This alignment ensures that Agentic SDLC Spec Kit provides a structured, high-velocity approach to AI-assisted development while maintaining quality and accountability.
