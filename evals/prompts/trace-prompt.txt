You are tasked with creating an AI session trace document for a completed feature implementation.

USER REQUIREMENTS:
{{ user_input }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a comprehensive session trace document that captures the implementation journey.

The trace MUST include these sections:

## Summary
- **Problem**: 1-2 sentence description of what needed to be implemented
- **Key Decisions**: Numbered chronological list of significant decisions made
- **Final Solution**: Brief outcome statement with key metrics

## 1. Session Overview
- Mission statement
- Key architectural decisions
- Implementation strategy and approach

## 2. Implementation Steps
For each major implementation step:
- What was done
- Why this approach was chosen
- Artifacts produced (files, tests, configs)
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved

## 3. Decisions Log
For each significant decision:
- Decision description
- Context (why it was needed)
- Options considered
- Choice made and rationale
- Impact on implementation

## 4. Quality Gates
- Tests written and results
- Code review findings (if applicable)
- Performance metrics (if applicable)
- Security considerations addressed

## 5. Artifacts
List of all artifacts produced:
- Source files created/modified
- Test files
- Configuration files
- Documentation updates

## 6. Lessons Learned
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Recommendations for future similar work

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Include specific file paths and commit references where applicable
- Document BOTH successful and failed approaches
- Include timestamps or ordering for chronological clarity
- All decisions must have rationale documented
- Trace must be self-contained and understandable without external context

OUTPUT: A complete session trace document.
