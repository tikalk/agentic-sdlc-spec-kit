You are tasked with creating an Architecture Description document.

USER REQUIREMENTS:
{{ user_input }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a comprehensive Architecture Description (AD) document following the Rozanski & Woods viewpoint framework.

IMPORTANT: Use ## (level 2) and ### (level 3) markdown headers for ALL sections below:

## 1. Introduction
- Purpose: Why this system exists
- Scope: In-scope and out-of-scope
- Definitions & Acronyms table

## 2. Stakeholders & Concerns
Table with: Stakeholder, Role, Key Concerns, Priority

## 3. Architectural Views (Rozanski & Woods)

### 3.1 Context View
- CRITICAL: Present the system as a SINGLE BLACKBOX
- Show ONLY: the system as one unified node, external actors, external systems, data flows crossing the boundary
- Do NOT show internal components, services, databases, or implementation details
- Include a context diagram (mermaid or ascii)
- Document external dependencies with SLA expectations and fallback strategies

### 3.2 Functional View
- Functional elements with responsibilities and interfaces
- Element interactions diagram
- Functional boundaries (what system does and does NOT do)

### 3.3 Information View
- Data entities with storage, owner, lifecycle, access patterns
- Data flow descriptions
- Data quality & integrity (consistency model, validation, retention, backup)

### 3.5 Development View
- Code organization (directory structure with annotations)
- Module dependencies and rules
- Build & CI/CD pipeline stages
- Development standards (coding, review, testing, docs)

### 3.6 Deployment View
- Runtime environments table (production, staging, development)
- Network topology diagram
- Hardware requirements
- Third-party services with SLAs

## 4. Architectural Perspectives (Cross-Cutting)

### 4.1 Security Perspective
- Authentication & Authorization
- Data Protection (encryption at rest, in transit, secrets management)
- Threat Model table

### 4.2 Performance & Scalability
- Performance requirements with targets
- Scalability model (horizontal, vertical, auto-scaling triggers)
- Capacity planning

## 5. Global Constraints & Principles
- Technical constraints
- Architectural principles

## 6. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
For each ADR include:
- Status (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Discovered)
- Context with problem statement and forces
- Decision with rationale
- Consequences (Positive, Negative, Risks)
- Common Alternatives with neutral trade-offs (NOT "rejected because")

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Context View MUST be a blackbox - no internal details
- ADRs must include evidence and confidence levels for discovered decisions
- Keep architecture proportional to system complexity
- Simple systems should have simple architectures (no over-engineering)
- For brownfield: infer decisions from code, mark confidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- For greenfield: design decisions based on requirements
- All views must be consistent with each other

OUTPUT: A complete Architecture Description document.
