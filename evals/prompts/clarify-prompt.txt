Your task is to produce a "Clarification Report" for the following user requirements.

The report must contain exactly three sections with the following markdown headings, in this exact order:
1. `## 1. Ambiguity Analysis`
2. `## 2. Clarification Questions`
3. `## 3. Suggested Defaults`

## Instructions

First, identify if this is a **system-level/architectural scenario** by looking for:
- Existing infrastructure or tech stack (e.g., "monolith", "Django", "PostgreSQL")
- Scale/performance requirements (e.g., "500 req/s", "50,000 concurrent users")
- Team composition (e.g., "3 backend developers")
- System constraints or deployment context

### For Architectural Scenarios:
Your clarification questions MUST focus on architectural decisions:
- **Real-time communication approach**: WebSocket vs SSE vs polling? How will real-time updates be delivered?
- **Scaling strategy**: Horizontal vs vertical scaling? Keep monolith or break into services? Database scaling approach?
- **Data flow patterns**: Pub/sub? Event streaming? Change data capture? Polling?
- **Team capacity vs complexity**: Does the proposed architecture match team size and expertise? Risk of over-engineering?
- **Infrastructure & deployment**: Caching strategy? Load balancing? Session management? Deployment model?

Focus on ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS, not feature details or project management.

### For Feature-level Scenarios:
Focus on functional requirements, edge cases, user experience, and acceptance criteria.
