You are tasked with creating a detailed feature specification.

USER REQUIREMENTS:
{{ user_input }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a comprehensive feature specification document that includes:

1. **Overview Section**: Brief description of the feature
2. **User Stories**: 5+ prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) with:
   - Clear "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
   - Detailed acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
   - Independent testability for each story
3. **Functional Requirements**: Specific, measurable, testable requirements (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability requirements (NFR-001, NFR-002, etc.)
5. **Edge Cases**: Document boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes (SC-001, SC-002, etc.)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT include technical implementation details (no specific frameworks, libraries, or tech stack)
- Focus on WHAT needs to be built, not HOW to build it
- All requirements must be measurable and testable
- Mark any vague or unclear requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

OUTPUT: A complete feature specification document.
