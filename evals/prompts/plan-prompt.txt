You are tasked with creating an implementation plan.

USER REQUIREMENTS:
{{ user_input }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a detailed implementation plan that includes:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of what will be implemented
2. **Project Structure**: Break down into ≤3 projects (simplicity gate)
3. **For Each Project**:
   - Clear scope and boundaries
   - Key tasks and milestones
   - Dependencies on other projects
   - Testing strategy
4. **Development Approach**: Phasing, deployment strategy
5. **Verification Steps**: How to validate each project

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (Constitution Principles):
- Keep it SIMPLE: ≤3 projects maximum
- No over-engineering: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- No premature optimization: Choose simple solutions first
- No microservices for simple apps
- No Kubernetes/service mesh unless truly needed
- Direct framework usage - no unnecessary abstractions

OUTPUT: A complete implementation plan document.
