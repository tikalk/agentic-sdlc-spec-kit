You are tasked with creating an implementation plan.

USER REQUIREMENTS:
{{ user_input }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a detailed implementation plan that includes:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of what will be implemented
2. **Project Structure**: Break down into ≤3 projects (MANDATORY simplicity gate)
   - For simple CRUD/todo apps: Aim for 1-2 projects
   - For apps with separate concerns: 2-3 projects maximum
   - Examples of appropriate project counts:
     * Simple todo app: 1 project (combined frontend + backend)
     * Todo app with API: 2 projects (Backend API, Frontend)
     * Complex system: 3 projects (Backend, Frontend, Background Worker)
   - REJECT the urge to over-engineer with unnecessary separation
3. **For Each Project**:
   - Clear scope and boundaries
   - Key tasks and milestones
   - Dependencies on other projects
   - Testing strategy
4. **Development Approach**: Phasing, deployment strategy
5. **Verification Steps**: How to validate each project

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (Constitution Principles):
- Keep it SIMPLE: ≤3 projects maximum (THIS IS A HARD LIMIT - violating this fails the plan)
- For basic CRUD/todo apps: 1-2 projects is usually sufficient
- No over-engineering: Avoid unnecessary complexity
  * Don't split into separate "API Gateway", "Auth Service", "Database Layer" for simple apps
  * Don't create a project for every logical component
  * Combine related concerns into single projects
- No premature optimization: Choose simple solutions first
- No microservices for simple apps (use monolith or simple client-server)
- No Kubernetes/service mesh unless truly needed (Docker Compose is fine for simple apps)
- Direct framework usage - no unnecessary abstractions or wrapper layers

OUTPUT: A complete implementation plan document.
