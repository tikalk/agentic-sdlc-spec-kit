# Implementation Plan: /levelup Command for Knowledge Loop Closure

**Branch**: `001-generate-the-specification` | **Date**: September 20, 2025 | **Spec**: /specs/001-generate-the-specification/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-generate-the-specification/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The /levelup command enables developers to capture and contribute learnings, best practices, or new patterns as versioned Markdown assets to the team-ai-directives repository. Each asset is placed in the correct context_modules/ subdirectory (e.g., rules/v1/, examples/v1/, personas/v1/) as defined by the repository's structure. The workflow includes AI-powered drafting, human-in-the-loop review, and automated Git workflow, ensuring traceability and compliance with the "Directives as Code" and "Team Capability" factors of the Agentic SDLC. A traceability comment is posted to the original issue tracker, closing the knowledge loop.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Bash (for CLI script), LLM API (external), GitHub CLI (gh)
**Primary Dependencies**: bash, gh CLI, LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
**Storage**: Git (team-ai-directives repo, context_modules/ subdirectories)
**Testing**: Manual confirmation, shell script testability, PR review
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS developer workstation
**Project Type**: single (CLI utility integrated into agentic-sdlc-spec-kit)
**Performance Goals**: Complete PR and traceability comment in <5 minutes per run
**Constraints**: Must not leak secrets, must halt on user rejection, must use absolute paths for reliability, must place assets in correct versioned context_modules/ directory
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user CLI, team-wide asset repository

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Library-First: The /levelup command is a CLI utility, not a library, but follows modular, testable script practices.
- CLI Interface: Exposes a CLI with text in/out, uses arguments and stdout/stderr for communication.
- Test-First: Manual confirmation and PR review act as test gates; future shell test coverage possible.
- Integration Testing: Relies on integration with gh CLI and LLM provider; manual integration test required.
- Simplicity: Script is single-file, minimal dependencies, clear user flow.

```

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context and spec.md:**
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the process allow for edits or abort if the user rejects the AI-generated drafts?]
   - LLM provider selection and API integration details
   - Security: How to ensure no secrets are leaked in logs or PRs
   - Error handling: Best practices for robust shell scripting with gh CLI
   - Traceability: Standard for issue tracker comment formatting
   - Asset placement: How to determine the correct context_modules/ subdirectory and version for each asset type
   - Versioning: How to handle new versions (v2, etc.) in context_modules/

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Task: "Research edit/abort flow for human-in-the-loop CLI tools"
   - Task: "Compare LLM providers for shell integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)"
   - Task: "Best practices for secret management in shell scripts and CI"
   - Task: "Robust error handling patterns for gh CLI in bash scripts"
   - Task: "Traceability comment standards for linking PRs to issue tracker tickets"
   - Task: "Best practices for asset placement and versioning in context_modules/ for team-ai-directives"

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable
   - Asset type (rule, example, persona), versioned path, and placement logic for context_modules/

2. **Generate CLI contract** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → CLI command/argument
   - Document expected file outputs (Markdown asset in context_modules/), PR metadata, and traceability comment
   - Output CLI usage and file placement contract to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per CLI scenario (e.g., asset creation, PR, traceability comment)
   - Assert correct file placement, PR metadata, and traceability comment content
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps
   - Validate asset is placed in correct context_modules/ directory and version

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file
   - All outputs must document and validate correct asset placement and versioning in context_modules/

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)
