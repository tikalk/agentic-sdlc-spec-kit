# Feature Specification: /levelup Command for Knowledge Loop Closure

**Feature Branch**: `001-generate-the-specification`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Generate the specification for a new /levelup command to be added to the spec-kit project, as tracked in @issue-tracker TIK-42. This command is the implementation of 'Stage 4: Leveling Up' from the Twelve-Factor Agentic SDLC manifesto. ..."


## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer, having completed a feature using the spec-kit workflow, wants to share a valuable learning (e.g., a new prompt, pattern, or rule) with the team. They run the /levelup command, describe the knowledge to capture, review the AI-generated asset and PR, and confirm submission. The knowledge is contributed to the central team-ai-directives repository, and a traceability comment is posted to the original issue tracker.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has completed a feature and identified a knowledge asset, **When** they run the /levelup command and provide a description, **Then** the system drafts the asset, PR, and comment, and presents them for review.
2. **Given** the developer reviews and confirms the drafts, **When** the system executes the workflow, **Then** a pull request is opened in the team-ai-directives repository and a traceability comment is posted to the issue tracker.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the developer rejects the AI-generated drafts? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the process allow for edits or abort?]
- How does the system handle authentication failures with the Git provider?
- What if the team-ai-directives repository is unavailable or the PR fails to open?


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a natural language prompt from the developer describing the knowledge to capture.
- **FR-002**: System MUST use an LLM to analyze the prompt and draft a knowledge asset, PR metadata, and issue tracker comment.
- **FR-003**: System MUST present all drafts to the developer for explicit review and confirmation before proceeding.
- **FR-004**: System MUST, upon confirmation, create a new branch in a local clone of the team-ai-directives repository, add the asset, commit, and push the branch.
- **FR-005**: System MUST open a pull request against the main branch of team-ai-directives with the drafted metadata.
- **FR-006**: System MUST post a traceability comment to the original issue tracker ticket, including a link to the new pull request.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle authentication with the Git provider using the gh CLI or standard credential helpers.
- **FR-008**: System MUST abort or allow edits if the developer rejects the AI-generated drafts. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Edit flow or abort only?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages for authentication or repository failures.
- **FR-010**: System MUST add the /levelup command to relevant agent configuration templates for discoverability.

### Key Entities
- **Knowledge Asset**: Represents the new directive, rule, or pattern to be contributed. Attributes: title, content, type (e.g., rule, example), author, date.
- **Pull Request Metadata**: Title, description, branch, target repository.
- **Traceability Comment**: Summary, link to PR, reference to original issue tracker ticket.
