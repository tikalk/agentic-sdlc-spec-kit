# adlc.architect.validate

Validate that the plan aligns with the architecture and identify any blocking issues.

## Usage

```
/architect.validate --for-plan
/architect.validate --json
/architect.validate --system-only
/architect.validate --check-only PILLAR_3
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--for-plan` | Validate against the generated plan (default behavior) |
| `--json` | Output findings in JSON format for easier parsing |
| `--system-only` | Check only system-level ADRs, ignore feature-level |
| `--check-only [check]` | Run only specific checks: PILLAR_1, PILLAR_2, PILLAR_3, or DIAGRAMS |

## Behavior

This is a **READ-ONLY** validation command. It does not modify any files.

### When Architecture Exists

If `.specify/drafts/adr.md` exists:
1. Load all ADRs from `.specify/drafts/adr.md`
2. Check if team-ai-directives is configured and load AD from `{TEAM_DIRECTIVES}/AD.md` if exists, else load from `AD.md` (project root)
3. Load the generated plan from `.specify/memory/plan.md`
4. Execute 7 PILLAR 3 checks:
   - **PILLAR_1**: Component-level ADR alignment with plan
   - **PILLAR_2**: Interface contracts match between plan and ADRs
   - **PILLAR_3**: Data model consistency between plan and architecture
   - **PILLAR_4**: Consistency between plan's Q1 user flows and architecture's System Context
   - **PILLAR_5**: Consistency between plan's interactions and architecture's Functional View
   - **PILLAR_6**: Consistency between plan's data model and architecture's Information View
   - **PILLAR_7**: Consistency between plan's dependencies and architecture's Development View
5. Check diagram consistency (system boundary matches, data flows valid)
6. Return findings with severity:
   - **blocking**: Must be fixed before proceeding
   - **high-severity**: Should be fixed before proceeding
   - **warnings**: Recommendations

### When Architecture Doesn't Exist

If `.specify/drafts/adr.md` doesn't exist:
- Skip validation gracefully
- Return `{"status":"skipped","reason":"architecture_not_found"}` if `--json` flag used

Example output:
```
⏭️  Architecture not found: .specify/drafts/adr.md
     Skipping validation gracefully
```

## Output Format

### Console Output (default)

```

## Integration

This command is automatically called by the `after_plan` hook:
- Validates plan alignment with architecture
- The command itself checks for architecture existence and skips gracefully
- Returns `{"status":"skipped","reason":"architecture_not_found"}` if no architecture exists

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success or skipped gracefully |
| 1 | Validation failed with blocking issues |
