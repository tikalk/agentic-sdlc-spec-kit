## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Multi-Agent Sub-System Analysis**: Complete refactor of `/levelup.init` with three-phase pipeline
  - **Discovery Agent** (Phase 5): Scans each sub-system for raw patterns with evidence
  - **Pattern Agent** (Phase 6): Classifies patterns, scores reusability (0.0-1.0), checks team-directives
  - **Synthesis Agent** (Phase 7): Cross-sub-system analysis generating final CDRs
  
- **Cross-Sub-System Pattern Detection**:
  - Detects patterns appearing in ≥50% of sub-systems (cross-cutting)
  - Calculates cross-system score per pattern
  - Flags high-priority cross-cutting concerns
  
- **Inconsistency Detection**:
  - Automatic detection of same concern with different implementations
  - Creates special "Inconsistency" CDRs requiring team decision
  - Tracks resolution status and implementation plan
  
- **State Management & Resumability**:
  - State persisted to `.specify/levelup/state.json`
  - Resume interrupted scans with `--resume` flag
  - Per-sub-system checkpoint tracking
  
- **Team-Directives Comparison**:
  - Pattern Agent checks for existing similar patterns
  - Similarity scoring (0.0-1.0)
  - Gap identification for missing patterns
  
- **Cross-Sub-System Validation in Implement**:
  - Phase 1.8: Detects duplicate targets, rule conflicts, unresolved inconsistencies
  - Blocks implementation until conflicts resolved
  - Recommends `/levelup.clarify` for resolution

### Changed

- `/levelup.init`: Complete rewrite with multi-agent architecture
  - Sequential execution per sub-system
  - State-based resumability
  - Cross-system metadata in all CDRs

  - Added state, subagents, cross_system configuration
  - New tags: subagents, cross-system-analysis, inconsistency-detection

### Technical Details

- **New Files**: 3 sub-agent prompt templates (discovery-prompt.md, pattern-prompt.md, synthesis-prompt.md)
- **Modified Files**: init.md, implement.md, cdr-template.md, extension.yml
- **Breaking Changes**: None (backward compatible)
- **Minimum speckit_version**: >=0.0.80 (unchanged)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Agent Memory Engineering**: Applied principles from production agent memory systems (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Hermes)

### Changed

- `/levelup.implement`:
  - Added Signal Gate phase (Phase 1.5) that filters CDRs without concrete evidence
  - Generates YAML frontmatter with `id`, `cdr_ref`, `created`, `modified`, `verified`, `age_days`
  - Adds freshness warning banner to published directives
  - Creates verification log table in directive files
  - Updated CDR.md index format with Created, Verified, Age columns

- `/levelup.validate`:
  - Added Phase 6: Verification Update (updates `verified` timestamps)
  - Resets `age_days` to 0 for valid directives
  - Reports stale directives (>30 days without verification)
  - Creates verification log entries

- `extension.yml`:
  - Version bump to 1.3.0
  - Added tags: `memory-engineering`, `signal-gate`, `verification`
  - Updated command descriptions
  - Added memory engineering defaults

- `config-template.yml`:
  - Added `[memory_engineering]` section with signal gate and verification settings

- `README.md`:
  - Added "Memory Engineering (v1.3.0)" section explaining signal gate and verification

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Skill Command Improvements** (6 patterns from best practices):
  - Pattern 1: Enhanced description with trigger keywords for better AI agent routing
  - Pattern 2: Converted all instructions to imperative verbs for clarity
  - Pattern 3: Added explicit output format specification in summary phase
  - Pattern 4: Added "Read Existing Skills" phase to match project patterns
  - Pattern 5: Added "Out of Scope" section for clear boundaries
  - Pattern 6: Merged SKILL.md templates and condensed content to <500 lines

### Changed

### Fixed

- Missing CHANGELOG entry for v1.1.9 (now documented)

## [1.1.9] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

## [1.1.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

## [1.1.7] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Auto-handoff to clarify**: Changed `send: false` to `send: true` in init.md (clarify handoff) and validate.md for automatic validation of discovered CDRs

### Changed

- `/adlc.levelup.init` now auto-triggers `/adlc.levelup.clarify` to validate discovered patterns
- `/adlc.levelup.validate` now auto-triggers `/adlc.levelup.clarify` to resolve conflicts

## [1.1.6] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Script path resolution**: Fixed session execution failures by using fully-qualified paths in command files
  - Changed from relative `scripts/bash/setup-levelup.sh` to `.specify/extensions/levelup/scripts/bash/setup-levelup.sh`

## [1.1.5] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Template path resolution**: Updated command templates to use `{REPO_ROOT}` prefix for `.specify/` paths
- **Team directives placeholder**: Changed relative `context_modules/` paths to use `{TEAM_DIRECTIVES}` prefix
- **Monorepo support**: Templates now correctly resolve paths when running from subdirectories

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **.specify directory detection**: All scripts now use `get_repo_root()` from common.sh to properly locate `.specify` directory when running from subdirectories
