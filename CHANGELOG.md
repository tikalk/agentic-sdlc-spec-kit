## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- feat: add Tabnine CLI agent support
- **Multi-Catalog Support (#1707)**: Extension catalog system now supports multiple active catalogs simultaneously via a catalog stack
  - New `specify extension catalog list` command lists all active catalogs with name, URL, priority, and `install_allowed` status
  - New `specify extension catalog add` and `specify extension catalog remove` commands for project-scoped catalog management
  - Default built-in stack includes `catalog.json` (default, installable) and `catalog.community.json` (community, discovery only) — community extensions are now surfaced in search results out of the box
  - `specify extension search` aggregates results across all active catalogs, annotating each result with source catalog
  - `specify extension add` enforces `install_allowed` policy — extensions from discovery-only catalogs cannot be installed directly
  - Project-level `.specify/extension-catalogs.yml` and user-level `~/.specify/extension-catalogs.yml` config files supported, with project-level taking precedence
  - `SPECKIT_CATALOG_URL` environment variable still works for backward compatibility (replaces full stack with single catalog)
  - All catalog URLs require HTTPS (HTTP allowed for localhost development)
  - New `CatalogEntry` dataclass in `extensions.py` for catalog stack representation
  - Per-URL hash-based caching for non-default catalogs; legacy cache preserved for default catalog
  - Higher-priority catalogs win on merge conflicts (same extension id in multiple catalogs)
  - 13 new tests covering catalog stack resolution, merge conflicts, URL validation, and `install_allowed` enforcement
  - Updated RFC, Extension User Guide, and Extension API Reference documentation

## [0.1.13] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Copilot Extension Commands Not Visible**: Fixed extension commands not appearing in GitHub Copilot when installed via `specify extension add --dev`
  - Changed Copilot file extension from `.md` to `.agent.md` in `CommandRegistrar.AGENT_CONFIGS` so Copilot recognizes agent files
  - Added generation of companion `.prompt.md` files in `.github/prompts/` during extension command registration, matching the release packaging behavior
  - Added cleanup of `.prompt.md` companion files when removing extensions via `specify extension remove`
- Fixed a syntax regression in `src/specify_cli/__init__.py` in `_build_ai_assistant_help()` that broke `ruff` and `pytest` collection in CI.
## [0.1.12] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- fix: use RELEASE_PAT so tag push triggers release workflow (#1736)
- fix: release-trigger uses release branch + PR instead of direct push to main (#1733)
- fix: Split release process to sync pyproject.toml version with git tags (#1732)


## [0.1.10] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Version Sync Issue (#1721)**: Fixed version mismatch between `pyproject.toml` and git release tags
  - Split release process into two workflows: `release-trigger.yml` for version management and `release.yml` for artifact building
  - Version bump now happens BEFORE tag creation, ensuring tags point to commits with correct version
  - Supports both manual version specification and auto-increment (patch version)
  - Git tags now accurately reflect the version in `pyproject.toml` at that commit
  - Prevents confusion when installing from source

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-28

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Parameter Ordering Issues (#1641)**: Fixed CLI parameter parsing issue where option flags were incorrectly consumed as values for preceding options
  - Added validation to detect when `--ai` or `--ai-commands-dir` incorrectly consume following flags like `--here` or `--ai-skills`
  - Now provides clear error messages: "Invalid value for --ai: '--here'"
  - Includes helpful hints suggesting proper usage and listing available agents
  - Commands like `specify init --ai-skills --ai --here` now fail with actionable feedback instead of confusing "Must specify project name" errors
  - Added comprehensive test suite (5 new tests) to prevent regressions

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **AI Skills Installation Bug (#1658)**: Fixed `--ai-skills` flag not generating skill files for GitHub Copilot and other agents with non-standard command directory structures
  - Added `commands_subdir` field to `AGENT_CONFIG` to explicitly specify the subdirectory name for each agent
  - Affected agents now work correctly: copilot (`.github/agents/`), opencode (`.opencode/command/`), windsurf (`.windsurf/workflows/`), codex (`.codex/prompts/`), kilocode (`.kilocode/workflows/`), q (`.amazonq/prompts/`), and agy (`.agent/workflows/`)
  - The `install_ai_skills()` function now uses the correct path for all agents instead of assuming `commands/` for everyone

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Qoder CLI detection**: Renamed `AGENT_CONFIG` key from `"qoder"` to `"qodercli"` to match the actual executable name, fixing `specify check` and `specify init --ai` detection failures

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Generic Agent Support**: Added `--ai generic` option for unsupported AI agents ("bring your own agent")
  - Requires `--ai-commands-dir <path>` to specify where the agent reads commands from
  - Generates Markdown commands with `$ARGUMENTS` format (compatible with most agents)
  - Example: `specify init my-project --ai generic --ai-commands-dir .myagent/commands/`
  - Enables users to start with Spec Kit immediately while their agent awaits formal support
