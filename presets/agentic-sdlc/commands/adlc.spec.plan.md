## MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Hooks

**STOP. Before reading User Input or doing ANY other work, execute extension hooks.**

0. Determine `{REPO_ROOT}` by running `git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null`. If that fails, walk up from the current directory until you find a `.git` directory or `.specify/init-options.json` and use that parent as `{REPO_ROOT}`.
1. If `{REPO_ROOT}/.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, state `No hooks file found` and skip to User Input.
2. Read `{REPO_ROOT}/.specify/extensions.yml` and find `hooks.before_plan`.
3. Skip any hook with `enabled: false`. Skip any hook with a non-empty `condition`.
4. For each remaining hook:
   - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`):
      ```
      ## Extension Hooks

      **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
      Executing: `/{command}`
      EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

      Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding.
      ```
      After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
   - **Optional** (`optional: true`): Display the hook name, command, and description. Let the user decide.
5. State which hooks were executed, then proceed to User Input.

---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `{REPO_ROOT}/.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
    - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - If the agent-context extension is installed and enabled, refresh the managed section (between the `<!-- SPECKIT START -->` and `<!-- SPECKIT END -->` markers) in the configured context file to point to the plan file created in step 1 (the IMPL_PLAN path). Run the agent-context update script if available; otherwise skip silently.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md

## Triage Framework: [SYNC] vs [ASYNC] Task Classification

Classify all implementation tasks as [SYNC] (human review required) or [ASYNC] (agent-delegated).
See `templates/plan-template.md` for full classification criteria, audit trail format, and examples.

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths for filesystem operations; use project-relative paths for references in documentation
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
- All implementation tasks must be classified as [SYNC] or [ASYNC] with documented rationale

## Post-Execution Hooks

1. If `{REPO_ROOT}/.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently.
2. Read `hooks.after_plan`.
3. Skip hooks with `enabled: false` or non-empty `condition`.
4. For each remaining hook:
   - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`):
      ```
      ## Extension Hooks

      **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
      Executing: `/{command}`
      EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
      ```
      After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
   - **Optional** (`optional: true`): Display hook info for user decision.
5. If no hooks registered, skip silently.
