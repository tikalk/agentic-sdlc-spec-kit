## Phase A: Pre-Approval Discovery Hooks (Read-Only)

**Execute ONLY read-only discovery hooks before showing the Mission Brief.**

1. If `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, state `No hooks file found` and skip to Mission Brief.
2. Read `.specify/extensions.yml` and find `hooks.before_specify`.
3. Skip any hook with `enabled: false`. Skip any hook with a non-empty `condition`.
4. **Classify each hook by mutation risk** (inspect the `{command}` name):
   - **Read-only / discovery hooks** (safe to run before approval):
     - `team-ai-directives.discover`, `team-ai-directives.constitution`
     - `agent-context.update` (read-only refresh)
     - Any command whose name contains `discover`, `verify`, `validate` (when used for read-only context gathering)
   - **Mutating hooks** (MUST be deferred until after Mission Brief approval):
     - `git.feature` — creates branches/worktrees
     - `git.commit` — creates commits
     - `git.initialize` — initializes repositories
     - Any hook that modifies filesystem, Git state, or creates resources
5. For each **read-only** hook:
   - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`): Execute the command file's full instructions NOW before continuing.
   - **Optional** (`optional: true`): Display the hook name, command, and description. Let the user decide.
6. For each **mutating** hook: do NOT execute yet. Note it for Phase B.
7. State which discovery hooks were executed, then proceed to Mission Brief.

**CRITICAL RULE**: No branch, worktree, commit, file, or directory may be created before the user explicitly approves the Mission Brief with "yes".

## ⚠️ MANDATORY STOP: Mission Brief

### Collect Mission Brief

If user input ($ARGUMENTS) is substantial (10+ words), extract the Mission Brief elements from it.
If minimal (< 10 words) or empty, ask the user these questions:

```markdown
## Mission Brief

**Question 1: What needs to be done?**
What is the primary feature or change you need?

**Question 2: What defines success?**
How will we know this is complete? 2-3 measurable outcomes.

**Question 3: Any constraints?**
Technical, business, or regulatory limitations?
```

### Display Mission Brief

After collecting/extracting answers, display:

```markdown
## Mission Brief

**Goal**: {goal}

**Success Criteria**:
- {criterion 1}
- {criterion 2}

**Constraints**:
- {constraint 1}
```

### ⚠️ STOP: Get User Confirmation

```markdown
**Proceed with this Mission Brief?** (yes / no / adjust)
```

**STOP HERE** - Wait for explicit response.

- **yes**: Proceed to Phase B (mutating hooks) and then spec creation.
  Write the approved Goal, Success Criteria, and Constraints into the
  spec header fields (Goal, Success Criteria, Constraints).
- **adjust**: Ask what needs changing, update the Mission Brief, re-display, ask again.
- **no**: Stop. Do not create branch or spec. Do not execute any deferred mutating hooks.

**DO NOT create branch, directory, or spec file until Mission Brief is approved with "yes".**

**Failure to follow these rules violates the __SPECKIT_COMMAND_SPECIFY__ contract.**

---

## Phase B: Post-Approval Mutating Hooks

**Only execute this phase after the user explicitly responds "yes" to the Mission Brief.**

1. For each **mutating** hook noted in Phase A:
   - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`): Read the command file for `{command}`. **First, read the extension's `extension.yml` manifest** and look up the `provides.commands` entry matching `{command}` to get the `file` field. Use that `file` path relative to the extension directory. If the manifest cannot be read, fall back to looking for `{command}.md` directly in the extension commands directory. Execute the command file's full instructions NOW before continuing.
   - **Optional** (`optional: true`): Display the hook name, command, and description. Let the user decide.
2. State which mutating hooks were executed.
3. If `git.feature` was executed and returned `BRANCH_NAME`/`FEATURE_NUM`, display:
   ```
   Branch created: {BRANCH_NAME} (Feature #{FEATURE_NUM})
   ```

---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_SPECIFY__` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the feature:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Branch creation** (already completed in Phase B if `git.feature` hook was present):

   The branch/worktree was created during Phase B mutating hooks (if applicable).
   Note the `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM` values for reference, but the branch name does **not** dictate the spec directory name.

   If the user explicitly provided `GIT_BRANCH_NAME`, it was already passed through to the hook in Phase B.

3. **Create the spec feature directory**:

   Specs live under the default `specs/` directory unless the user explicitly provides `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`.

   **Resolution order for `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`**:
   1. If the user explicitly provided `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` (e.g., via environment variable, argument, or configuration), use it as-is
   2. Otherwise, auto-generate it under `specs/`:
      - Check `.specify/init-options.json` for `branch_numbering`
      - If `"timestamp"`: prefix is `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (current timestamp)
      - If `"sequential"` or absent: prefix is `NNN` (next available 3-digit number after scanning existing directories in `specs/`)
      - Construct the directory name: `<prefix>-<short-name>` (e.g., `003-user-auth` or `20260319-143022-user-auth`)
      - Set `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` to `specs/<directory-name>`

   **Create the directory and spec file**:
   - `mkdir -p SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`
   - Copy `templates/spec-template.md` to `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/spec.md` as the starting point
   - Set `SPEC_FILE` to `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/spec.md`
   - Persist the resolved path to `.specify/feature.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "feature_directory": "<resolved feature dir>"
     }
     ```
     Write the actual resolved directory path value (for example, `specs/003-user-auth`), not the literal string `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`.
     This allows downstream commands (`__SPECKIT_COMMAND_PLAN__`, `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TASKS__`, etc.) to locate the feature directory without relying on git branch name conventions.

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - You must only create one feature per `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_SPECIFY__` invocation
   - The spec directory name and the git branch name are independent — they may be the same but that is the user's choice
   - The spec directory and file are always created by this command, never by the hook

4. Load `templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

5. Follow this execution flow:
    1. Parse user description from arguments
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

6. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

7. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

      ## Content Quality

      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed

      ## Requirement Completeness

      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

      ## Feature Readiness

      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

      ## Notes

      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_CLARIFY__` or `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_PLAN__`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 7

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]

           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]

           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]

           **Suggested Answers**:

           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|---------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |

           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

8. **Report completion** to the user with:
   - `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` — the feature directory path
   - `SPEC_FILE` — the spec file path
   - Checklist results summary
   - Readiness for the next phase (`__SPECKIT_COMMAND_CLARIFY__` or `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_PLAN__`)

**NOTE:** Branch creation is handled by the `before_specify` hook (git extension) during **Phase B** (after Mission Brief approval). Spec directory and file creation are always handled by this core command, also after approval.

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: Use project-appropriate patterns (REST/GraphQL for web services, function calls for libraries, CLI args for tools, etc.)

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

## Post-Execution Hooks

1. If `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently.
2. Read `hooks.after_specify`.
3. Skip hooks with `enabled: false` or non-empty `condition`.
4. For each remaining hook:
   - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`): Read the command file for `{command}`. **First, read the extension's `extension.yml` manifest** and look up the `provides.commands` entry matching `{command}` to get the `file` field. Use that `file` path relative to the extension directory. If the manifest cannot be read, fall back to looking for `{command}.md` directly in the extension commands directory. Execute the command file's full instructions immediately.
   - **Optional** (`optional: true`): Display hook info for user decision.
5. If no hooks registered, skip silently.
